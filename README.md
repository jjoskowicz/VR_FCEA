The sum_aov.R script analyzes academic performance data from an Excel file using descriptive statistics and ANOVA/ANCOVA models. It computes an Incremental Score (IS) as the difference between final and initial diagnostic tests, summarizes final exam results and learning gains by experimental Group and Dimensionality (Dim), and evaluates whether these factors have a statistically significant effect on outcomes. 
The analysis includes models with and without covariate adjustment (initial diagnostic score) and repeats all tests for the full sample and for students who met attendance requirements, checking standard assumptions (normality and homoscedasticity) for each model.
